								<h3>Analysis and Representation of Data from the Ministry of Health in Ecuador</h3>
								<p>The project was part of a research contest at the Universidad Politécnica Salesiana in Ecuador and focused on the analysis and representation of data from the Ministry of Health in Ecuador, centering on the 7 most common clinical data points. The main goal was to raise awareness about the state of health in the country to inform and prevent future issues. To achieve this, techniques such as creating maps were used to show the geographic distribution of cases by province, highlighting those with the highest frequency. In addition, diseases and their causes were detailed to provide a deeper understanding of the situation. The project was developed in R Studio, leveraging its capabilities to handle large datasets, as it included over a million records. Specialized libraries for data analysis and visualization were used, allowing for a clear and effective representation of the information obtained from the Ministry of Health.</p>
